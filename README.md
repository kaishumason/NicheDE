# NicheDE
NicheDE is a method that detects context dependent changes in gene expression in spatial transcriptomic data.
In particular, nicheDE characterizes a cell's neighborhood into a vector called the effective niche. 
By regressing gene expression on the effective niche, nicheDE can determine if a gene is up or down regulated
in a specified cell type in the context of specific spatial niches.\
